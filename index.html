                <h3>Understanding the problem</h3>
                <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) reported in 2018 that Canadians could expect to live up to 82.8 years, which is an increase of over 10 years since the 1960s. However, major global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine War have had a significant impact on people's lives. Seniors, in particular, have been severely affected, with 33% reporting that their mental health has worsened during the pandemic, according to Statistics Canada.</p>
                <p>Pervasive technologies have the potential to enhance the self-sufficiency, social engagement, and confidence of elderly people by enabling them to lead more active and healthy independent lives. However, the acceptance and adoption of these technologies have been limited, partly due to the lack of adaptable and elder-friendly design. To ensure that the aging population benefits from advances in pervasive computing, there needs to be a focus on designing user-friendly technologies that cater to the diversity of aging populations.</p>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>Creating applications specifically for seniors is not a novel concept. At present, there are several applications and services accessible that enable senior consumers to manage their physical and mental well-being. However, most of them do not offer complete elder-friendly design or have an overwhelming number of features that can be confusing.

                <h4>Color Palette</h4>
                <p>The choice of a color palette is an important decision when creating any design or visual material. The final color palette is a popular choice for several reasons. Green and blue are calming and soothing colors that are often associated with nature, growth, and stability. These colors work well together, creating a harmonious and balanced effect. Off-white, on the other hand, is a neutral color that provides a clean and sophisticated background, allowing the green and blue to stand out while maintaining a sense of elegance. Additionally, this color palette is versatile and can be used in various contexts, from corporate branding to website design.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Designing this application posed several challenges, with the most significant one being the need to understand the core problem at hand. We had to delve deeper into the underlying pain points that caused user frustrations due to the lack of elder-friendly design. Through careful analysis of the data gathered from our research, we were able to identify the most common problem areas faced by elder-users. In creating the web application, we made use of the insights gained during our research. Our goal was to design a web application that is not only easy to use but also simple and reliable.</p>
